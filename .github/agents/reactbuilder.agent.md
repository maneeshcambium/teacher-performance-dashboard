3. Axios
4. React Hooks
5. TypeScript
6. Chart.js

## Application Summary

An application for teachers to see aggregate performance of all students on various tests. The tests could be on multiple subjects like Math, ELA, Science, Social and others. There is a dashboard where we can evaluate class scores against district and school. The application provides a graphical representation (Charts) of student performance against last few years.

## Requirements

1. Create a login page for school teacher users. You can mock the API call response.

2. On the home page, teacher has an option to pick a school, school year, and test. It would show:
   - A list of all students
   - Their scores on the test
   - Aggregate scores against school and district for the same test
